# auto-reply-form-gmail-n8n
built an automated-reply gmail after submitted a form using n8n

- created a form in n8n and connected it to my google sheets
- the data from the form will be extracted into my google sheets
- need to fill : Full name, email, working and birthday
- then added a filter: if the submitter is working, then it will get an auto reply email saying Goodluck working into their gmai. if not, then will not recieved the reply
-  the email will sent to submitter gmail (so use your legit gmail to try)


i posted the workflow, it's using only 4 nodes and it is a simple and beginner-friendly project.

RN i'm exploring to use API in n8n, planning to make a simple telegram bot that can send reminder daily about forecast.
